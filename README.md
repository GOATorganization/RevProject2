# RevProject2

We will have Master - Dev - Feature work flow. 

I want us to woek based on user stories so hopefully we will have everyone touching all the parts of the project.
I think I set up the git repo correctly so that the master and dev branches are properly protected and you will have to 
merge with the master branch before you will be allowed to issue a pull request. 


Would you guys think this flow is ok?
I think we should have several long lived branches for each user story and from each user story, the person responsible for that is in charge of their branch and create feature branches and merge into their own long lived branches as fit.
